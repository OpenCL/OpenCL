# <a name="S-introduction"></a>OpenCL Introduction

## What is OpenCL?

OpenCL is an open, royalty-free industry standard that makes much faster computations possible through parallel computing. The standard is controlled by non-profit standards organisation Khronos. For example, by using this technology with graphics cards and modern multi-core processors it is possible to convert a video in 20 minutes instead of 2 hours, or analyze spectra of hundreds of thousands of stars in minutes instead of several hours.

## How does it work?

OpenCL is an extension to existing languages. It makes it possible to specify a piece of code that is executed multiple times independently from each other. This code can run on various processors – not only the main CPU. Also, OpenCL has built-in support for vector types (float2, short4, int8, long16, etc), and operations on those types can be mapped to vector extensions of modern CPUs (SSE, AVX).

>For example, you need to calculate `sin(x)` of a large array `A` of one million numbers. Based on the information provided by the OpenCL framework you can pick the best device, or even several devices, and send the data to the device(s). Normally you would loop over the million numbers, one number after another, but with OpenCL you can just say: "For each `x` in array `A` give me `sin(x)`", and each `x` is processed in parallel. When finished, you can take the data back from the device(s) or proceed with other computations.

OpenCL framework is great at exposing parallel nature of various compute-devices: x86 CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, DSPs. This can significantly lower the total execution time compared to conventional sequential methods.

## 5 questions on OpenCL

**Q: Why is it so fast?**

>OpenCL framework gives programmers tools and features which enable them to implement efficient parallel algorithms. It does it by providing direct access to the cores of multi-core CPUs, and to the hundreds of little processors on graphics cards. 

**Q: Does it work on any type of hardware?**

>As it is an open standard, it can work on any type of hardware that targets parallel execution. This can be a CPU, GPU, DSP or FPGA. You can read more in [Platforms and tools](#S-platforms) chapter.

**Q: How does it compare to OpenMP/MPI?**

>Where OpenMP and MPI try to split loops over threads/servers and is CPU-oriented, OpenCL focuses on getting threads being data-position aware and making use of processor-capabilities.

**Q: Does it replace C or C++?**

>No, it is a framework which integrates well with C, C++, Python, Java and more.

**Q: How stable/mature is OpenCL?**

>First version of OpenCL was released in 2009. The latest version is OpenCL 2.1 from November 2015. The standard is being actively developed. Next version (2.2), which currently has provisional status, will include OpenCL C++ kernel language based C++14 standard.

# <a name="S-libraries"></a>Libraries

The crucial part of every technology and programming language are libraries. They extend the language, simplify it, add new features, and help you build you applications faster. The same goes for OpenCL. This chapter presents a few selected libraries which at the time seemed popular, useful and reliable.

## Wrappers 

### [OpenCL-CLHPP](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-CLHPP)

OpenCL Host API C++ bindings. 

> For many large applications C++ is the language of choice and so it seems reasonable to define C++ bindings for OpenCL.

> The interface is contained with a single C++ header file cl2.hpp and all definitions are contained within the namespace cl. There is no additional requirement to include cl.h and to use either the C++ or original C bindings; it is enough to simply include cl2.hpp.

> The bindings themselves are lightweight and correspond closely to the underlying C API. Using the C++ bindings introduces no additional execution overhead.

* Homepage: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-CLHPP
* Documentation: http://github.khronos.org/OpenCL-CLHPP

### [Boost.Compute](https://github.com/boostorg/compute/)

Boost.Compute is an official Boost library, added to the Boost C++ Libraries package since 1.61 version. It is a comprehensive wrapper for OpenCL 1.0 - 2.0. It provides STL-like algorithms and various helper features (functions, classes) which make developing in C++/OpenCL environment much faster.

> Boost.Compute is a GPU/parallel-computing library for C++ based on OpenCL.

> The core library is a thin C++ wrapper over the OpenCL API and provides access to compute devices, contexts, command queues and memory buffers.

> On top of the core library is a generic, STL-like interface providing common algorithms (e.g. `transform()`, `accumulate()`, `sort()`) along with common containers (e.g. `vector<T>`, `flat_set<T>`). It also features a number of extensions including parallel-computing algorithms (e.g. `exclusive_scan()`, `scatter()`, `reduce()`) and a number of fancy iterators (e.g. `transform_iterator<>`, `permutation_iterator<>`, `zip_iterator<>`).

### [AMD Aparapi](https://github.com/aparapi/aparapi)

Aparapi enables Java developers to define OpenCL kernels and executed them on GPU and APU devices.

>Aparapi allows Java developers to take advantage of the compute power of GPU and APU devices by executing data parallel code fragments on the GPU rather than being confined to the local CPU. It does this by converting Java bytecode to OpenCL at runtime and executing on the GPU, if for any reason Aparapi can't execute on the GPU it will execute in a Java thread pool.

> We like to think that for the appropriate workload this extends Java's 'Write Once Run Anywhere' to include GPU devices.

## The OpenCL Architecture

The crucial part of The OpenCL Specification is the chapter about the OpenCL architecture. It is very important to understand at least its basic principles. Without this knowledge it is not possible neither to efficiently program using OpenCL nor to use it to its full capabilities. 

The architecture is described by four models:

* Platform Model
* Memory Model
* Programming Model
* Execution Model

The platform model describes in general how the OpenCL framework looks like and gives definitions of a host and an OpenCL device. The memory model explains different memory regions and memory objects introduced in OpenCL. More advanced sections about memory model present details of how shared virtual memory mechanism works, and presents memory consistency model and ordering rules. Since OpenCL 2.0 the programming model does not have its own section. It specifies that the OpenCL execution model supports both data parallel and task parallel programming models.

The execution model is the model that explains how the OpenCL framework really works. It defines responsibilities of a host program, it says what is a command queue, what is a kernel, and it describes how an execution of an OpenCL kernel on a device works. In order to understand OpenCL you must carefully read and understand particularly this part of the specification, and know: how workloads are mapped onto devices, when synchronization happens, what is an index space.

ToDo

## <a name="S-get-started-cl-basic"></a>[CL-basic](https://github.com/OpenCL/CL-basic)

CL-basic is a C prototype to help you get started with creating your first simple OpenCL application. It offers simplified host-code OpenCL API functions and a sample OpenCL kernel that you can reference to get started quick! In addition, this prototype can be compiled under both Windows and Linux-based systems thanks to the use of CMake.

Host-code functions can be found in files:
> `cl_util.c`

> `cl_util.h`

For getting platform and/or device information, use the following functions are:
```c
void PrintPlatformName(cl_platform_id platform);
void PrintDeviceName(cl_device_id device);
int PrintOpenCLInfo();
void SelectOpenCLPlatformAndDevice(cl_platform_id* pPlatform, cl_device_id* pDevice);
```

For creating and releasing an OpenCL context, the following functions are:
```c
cl_context CreateOpenCLContext(cl_platform_id platform, cl_device_id device);
void ReleaseOpenCLContext(cl_context *pContext);
```

For creating and releasing an OpenCL command queue, the following functions are:
```c
cl_command_queue CreateOpenCLQueue(cl_device_id device, cl_context context);
void ReleaseOpenCLQueue(cl_command_queue *pQueue);
```

For creating and releasing an OpenCL buffer allocated on an OpenCL device, the following functions are:
```c
cl_mem CreateDeviceBuffer(cl_context context, size_t sizeInBytes);
void ReleaseDeviceBuffer(cl_mem *pDeviceBuffer);
```

For copying data rom the host to device, or from the device to the host, the following functions are:
```c
void CopyHostToDevice(void* hostBuffer, cl_mem deviceBuffer, size_t sizeInBytes, cl_command_queue queue, cl_bool blocking);
void CopyDeviceToHost(cl_mem deviceBuffer, void* hostBuffer, size_t sizeInBytes, cl_command_queue queue, cl_bool blocking);
```

For loading an OpenCL source from a file, creating and releasing the OpenCL program, the following functions are:
```c
char* LoadOpenCLSourceFromFile(char* filePath, size_t *pSourceLength);
cl_program CreateAndBuildProgram(cl_context context, char* sourceCode, size_t sourceCodeLength);
void ReleaseProgram(cl_program *pProgram);
```

For creating and releasing OpenCL Kernels, the following functions are:
```c
cl_kernel CreateKernel(cl_program program, char* kernelName);
void ReleaseKernel(cl_kernel *pKernel);
```

A macro for checking error values has also been prepared to make it easier to translate an error code returned by an OpenCL host function, and it can be used as below:
```c
clError = clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(queue, simpleFunctionKernel, workDim, NULL, globalWorkSize, localWorkSize, 0, NULL, NULL);
CHECK_OCL_ERR("clEnqueueNDRangeKernel", clError);
```

Refer to `main.cpp` for a reference of how these host-code functions are used, and `OpenCLKernels.cl` for how the OpenCL kernel is written.

## <a name="S-profiling-cl-events"></a>Using OpenCL events

OpenCL framework has a built-in feature that can provide information about the execution times of enqueued commands.
By linking `cl_event` object to an OpenCL command, like `clEnqueueNDRangeKernel`, it is possible to use `clGetEventProfilingInfo` function to get the times of the start and the end of execution of that command and calulcate the performance. Profiling of OpenCL commands can be enabled by using a command queue created with `CL_QUEUE_PROFILING_ENABLE` flag set in properties argument.

### Supported queries

```c
cl_int clGetEventProfilingInfo(cl_event event,
                               cl_profiling_info param_name,
                               size_t param_value_size,
                               void *param_value,
                               size_t *param_value_size_ret)
```

`CL_PROFILING_COMMAND_QUEUED`

A 64-bit value that describes the current device time counter in nanoseconds when the command identified by event is enqueued in a command-queue by the host.

`CL_PROFILING_COMMAND_SUBMIT`

A 64-bit value that describes the current device time counter in nanoseconds when the command identified by event that has been enqueued is submitted by the host to the device associated with the command-queue.

`CL_PROFILING_COMMAND_START`

A 64-bit value that describes the current device time counter in nanoseconds when the command identified by event starts execution on the device.

`CL_PROFILING_COMMAND_END`

A 64-bit value that describes the current device time counter in nanoseconds when the command identified by event has finished execution on the device.

`CL_PROFILING_COMMAND_COMPLETE` (since OpenCL 2.1)

A 64-bit value that describes the current device time counter in nanoseconds when the command identified by event and any child commands enqueued by this command on the device have finished execution.

### Example using OpenCL C API and CL-Basic:

First, the commend queue used to execute kernels must be created with `CL_QUEUE_PROFILING_ENABLE` flag:

```c
#ifdef CL_VERSION_2_0
    cl_queue_properties prop[] = { CL_QUEUE_PROPERTIES, CL_QUEUE_PROFILING_ENABLE, 0 };

    queue = clCreateCommandQueueWithProperties(context, device, prop, &clError);
    CHECK_OCL_ERR("clCreateCommandQueueWithProperties", clError);
#else
    cl_command_queue_properties prop = 0;
    prop |= CL_QUEUE_PROFILING_ENABLE;

    queue = clCreateCommandQueue(context, device, prop, &clError);
    CHECK_OCL_ERR("clCreateCommandQueue", clError);
#endif
```

Then, you can enqueue a kernel, wait for completion and use associated event object and function `clGetEventProfilingInfo` to calculate the execution time:

```c
cl_event event;

err = clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(
    queue, kernel, 1, NULL, &global_work_size, NULL, 0, NULL, &event
);
CHECK_OCL_ERR("clEnqueueNDRangeKernel", err);

err = clWaitForEvents(1, &event);
CHECK_OCL_ERR("clWaitForEvents", err);

cl_ulong start_time, end_time;
err = clGetEventProfilingInfo(
    event, CL_PROFILING_COMMAND_START, sizeof(cl_ulong), &start_time, NULL
);
CHECK_OCL_ERR("clGetEventProfilingInfo", err);
err = clGetEventProfilingInfo(
    event, CL_PROFILING_COMMAND_END, sizeof(cl_ulong), &end_time, NULL
);
CHECK_OCL_ERR("clGetEventProfilingInfo", err);

printf("%lu\n", end_time - start_time);

err = clReleaseEvent(event);
CHECK_OCL_ERR("clReleaseEvent", err);
```

## <a name="S-profiling-on-host"></a>Benchmarking on host

If you can't or don't want to use `CL_QUEUE_PROFILING_ENABLE` flag, it is also possible to benchmark kernels, or in general any OpenCL function, using features of the host language that you use OpenCL with. However, in that case it is important to always run the kernel multiple times in order to get the correct average execution time.

### C++11 Example (with CL-basic)

```cpp
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>

(...)

using ms_duration_type = std::chrono::duration<double, std::milli>;
duration_type sum_durations(0);

// Remember to compile kernel before benchmarking.

const size_t iterations_count = 100;
for (size_t iteration = 0; iteration < iterations_count; iteration++)
{
    cl_event event;

    // Preparation: set kernel arguments, fill input buffers etc.

    auto start_time =
        std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

    err = clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(
        queue, kernel, 1,
        NULL, &global_work_size, &local_work_size,
        0, NULL, &event
    );
    CHECK_OCL_ERR("clEnqueueNDRangeKernel", err);

    err = clWaitForEvents(1, &event);
    CHECK_OCL_ERR("clWaitForEvents", err);

    ms_duration_type duration = 
        std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now() - start_time;
    sum_durations += duration;

    err = clReleaseEvent(event);
    CHECK_OCL_ERR("clReleaseEvent", err);
}

auto avg_duration = sum_durations / iterations_count;
std::cout << avg_duration.count() << " ms\n";

(...)
```

### C++11 Example (with Boost.Compute)

```cpp
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <boost/compute.hpp>

(...)

using ms_duration_type = std::chrono::duration<double, std::milli>;
duration_type sum_durations(0);

// Remember to compile kernel before benchmarking.

const size_t iterations_count = 100;
for (size_t iteration = 0; iteration < iterations_count; iteration++)
{
    // Preparation: set kernel arguments, fill input buffers etc.

    auto start_time =
        std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

    queue.enqueue_1d_range_kernel(
        kernel, 0 /* offset */, global_work_size, local_work_size
    ).wait();

    ms_duration_type duration = 
        std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now() - start_time;
    sum_durations += duration;
}

auto avg_duration = sum_durations / iterations_count;
std::cout << avg_duration.count() << " ms\n";

(...)
```
