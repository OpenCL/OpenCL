# Contributing

Contributing is easy. Be sure to read the license agreement for content on the site. If you are new to Github, take a tutorial
from the [Github guide](https://guides.github.com/), in particular [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/),
and [Forking](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/). Then simply fork the repository, make changes in your fork and then 
make a pull request. Much of the documentation uses Markdown, so you may also want to read the 
[Markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Finally, much discussion occurs through Github issues,
so the [Issue guide](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) may also be helpful.

A [code of conduct](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/) will appear shortly, but suggestions on this are welcome 
- feel free to file an issue.

At present, most of the information on the site is in English. Translations to and from other languages are welcome!
