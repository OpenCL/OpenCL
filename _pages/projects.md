This is the most important part of OpenCL.org. Here is where we build the OpenCL ecosphere that is still unfinished.

OpenCL exists of core specifications, as provided by <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">The Khronos Group</a> and core functionality as provided by the various vendors. Then it's a steep wall down.

By various projects, we're going to make that wall less steep. Together.

For other initiatives see the sections 'Coding' and 'Tools'.
