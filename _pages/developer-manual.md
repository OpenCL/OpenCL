The man-pages of OpenCL are actually the language specifications and target implementers, not developers. This project is to create man-pages for developers, inspired by great websites like cppreference.com. 

Update: the project has been migrated to [Khronos](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/sdk/latest/docs/man/html)
